In 1982, a captive breeding program was started. Here, more than 20 elephants have been bred since the program's start. The orphanage strives to provide these elephants with a natural environment. There are, however, a few exceptions: all of the infants under three years old are still bottle fed by the mahouts and volunteers, and the elephants are bathed twice daily in the river.",
      "indexS2P5": "The orphanage's main goal has been to give abandoned adult elephants and newborn elephants that are lost in the wild a lifeline. There have been numerous instances where the mother of an orphaned baby elephant has died, or where newborn elephants have fallen into pits and lost out to the herd by accident. In other cases, the mother elephant perished in a pit and left the young elephant alone in the forest. There are cases where farmers have slain adult elephants to safeguard their crops and rice fields, leaving the young elephants orphaned.To provide the unfortunate victims of such circumstances the greatest chance possible, the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage was established. Pinnawala (Pinnawela) Elephant Orphanage: captive breeding The orphanage's elephants receive complete support from a team of over 100 workers, including a number of mahouts, and are not subjected to any kind of stress, abuse, or threat. Elephants can mate because of the herd's freedom of mobility within the orphanage's confined territory. The first infant elephant at Pinnawela was born in 1984. Some of these children are fortunate enough to witness the birth of their third generation at the orphanage today.",

The Sri Lankan leopard personifies the pinnacle of feline grace with its elegant golden-yellow coat covered with characteristic dark markings and rosettes.These amazing animals live mostly in the nation's national parks and conservation areas, where they are able to adapt to a range of environments, from grasslands to deep woods. Sri Lankan leopards are well-known for their versatility and their exceptional hunting skills. They prey on a wide variety of animals, such as deer, wild boar, and smaller mammals.Despite their majestic presence, Sri Lankan leopards struggle with issues like habitat degradation and conflict between people and wildlife. For this rare subspecies to survive, conservation activities are essential. Yala and Wilpattu national parks, which offer both locals and tourists a view into the fascinating world of these mysterious big cats, have emerged as crucial strongholds for the conservation of the Sri Lankan leopard.In addition to protecting an important part of the island's ecology, the protection of Sri Lankan leopards is a symbol of the country's dedication to protecting its natural legacy for coming generations to value and enjoy.Leopocon Sri Lanka is a nonprofit organization based in Sri Lanka devoted exclusively to the conservation of Sri Lankan leopards and their ecosystems.",

      "leoS2P1": "Due to habitat loss and fragmentation brought about mainly by human activities including agriculture, urbanization, and infrastructure development, the Sri Lankan leopard is seriously threatened. The habitats of leopards become more fragmented as human populations grow, which hinders the animals' ability to travel freely and decreases the amount of prey that is available.The destruction and fragmentation of the once-expansive territory of leopards is a result of human activities encroaching into their habitats. Due to deforestation caused by logging, infrastructure development, and agriculture, leopards have fewer and more secluded places to roam. Their capacity to acquire a variety of prey, locate partners, and preserve genetic variation within the population is all hampered by the fragmentation. Consequently, this upsets the delicate balance of the ecosystems that leopards live in in addition to having a direct effect on the animals.",
      "leoS2H3":"2.Human-Wildlife Conflict",
      "leoS2P2": "An further significant hazard to Sri Lankan leopards is the growing frequency of conflicts between humans and wildlife. Competition for resources leads to conflicts as human populations grow into leopard areas. When domestic animals are preyed upon by leopards, enraged communities may retaliate by murdering the leopards in order to save their livestock and way of life.Conflicts intensify as settlements and human populations spread into leopard habitats. Leopards are forced to look for alternate food sources when their natural prey is lost due to habitat disturbance, which frequently brings them into contact with domestic animals. Conflicts with the local population arise from this, which sometimes leads to retaliatory kills and unfavorable views of leopards. Beyond the immediate death of individual leopards, these fights have a larger negative impact on conservation efforts by fostering a generalized attitude of dread and animosity towards these majestic carnivores.",
      "leoS2H4":"Consequences",
      "leoS2H5" : "1. Protected corridors and areas",
      "leoS2P3": "Protected areas and wildlife corridors are being established and maintained in an effort to lessen habitat loss and fragmentation. Leopards depend on national parks and reserves like Yala and Wilpattu as secure havens for mating, hunting, and migration.In addition to the establishment of protected areas, ongoing conservation efforts prioritize the creation and maintenance of wildlife corridors. These corridors act as connective pathways between fragmented habitats, allowing leopards and other wildlife to traverse from one area to another. By facilitating the movement of individuals and maintaining gene flow between populations, wildlife corridors play a pivotal role in preserving genetic diversity and preventing the isolation of groups.Collaboration between local communities, environmentalists, governmental agencies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is common in these endeavors. Involving local populations is essential for the effectiveness of conservation activities, even outside the official protection of national parks. A balance between human activities and wildlife habitats is advocated through the promotion of sustainable land-use practices and responsible tourist efforts. Human-wildlife conflicts can be decreased by educating communities on the value of protecting leopards and encouraging coexistence.",
      "leoS2H6":"2.Conservation Imbalance",
      "leoS2P4": "Conflicts between humans and wildlife frequently result in leopards being killed in retaliation, which upsets the ecosystem's balance. The loss of these top predators can upset the delicate balance of nature and have a cascading effect on prey populations throughout the ecosystem.Apex predators such as the Sri Lankan leopard have the ability to disappear, which might have a cascading effect on many species and biological processes in the ecosystem. In the absence of these dominant predators, herbivore populations—like those of deer and wild boar—may grow uncontrollably. Overgrazing may result from this unrestrained development, which would be detrimental to the vegetation and plant ecosystems. The effects go farther, impacting other wildlife that depends on these plants for food and cover.In addition, the lack of leopards as natural predators throws prey species' behavioral patterns off. Without the impact of the top predator, herbivores become less alert and change the way they forage. These modifications may lead to localized habitat loss, which would affect many smaller organisms that depend on a healthy environment in addition to the vegetation."
